                Target, Sony, Yahoo!, Experian, Go Daddy are all names you may recognize from recent news articles – and
                not just because of their relevance to your personal life. These major corporations are all victims of
                recent cybercrimes that hit newsstands over the last few years. Many of these incidents could have been
                prevented by increased training and vigilance at all levels of the company. Recognizing suspicious cyber
                behavior is the first step in protecting yourself, and your company, from ending up in the news.

                A common thread in many high profile breaches is the use of social engineering. Social engineering
                manipulates human behavior to perform some action or divulge confidential and/or sensitive
                information—all without the end user’s knowledge. It plays a vital role in many cyberattacks because,
                quite simply, it usually works. But if we invest in our employees as the first line of cyber defense, we
                can make sure we are equipped to handle these attacks.
