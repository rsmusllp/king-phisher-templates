# Phishing Awareness Email 

## Objective
Shell

## Pretext 
You are an executive or HR rolling out a new or updated policy. In this case, we're going with a BYOD since it's applicable to everyone. A new employee handbook goes well too, but that's usually an annual thing. Either way, your policy contains a malicous macro that gets you shell. 
 

## Modify
1. File: email.html
  * Nothing, unless you'd like to change the policy name

2. Attach a Word document
  * Create a document containing an auto run macro.
  * Empire is the easiest method.
