		<p>The email you just received in was delivered as part of {{ client.company_name }}'s Security Awareness Campaign. You are seeing this page because you've clicked the link contained within the email. Had this been a real attack, your company could have been compromised as a result.</p>
		
		<h3>What is Phishing?</h3>
		<p>Phishing is a type of social engineering attack which utilizes email as a way to obtain credentials, gather information, or send malware to a user's computer. These messages often entice targets to click a link to visit a malicious website or download a malicious file through a variety of ways including:
			<ul>
				<li>Appearing to come from a legitimate email address</li>
				<li>Playing on emotions causing the target to act irrationally</li>
				<li>Legitimate looking websites and/or emails</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>

		<h3>Why Should I Care?</h3>
		<p>Believe it or not, you are a target both at work and at home. You and your devices are critical entrypoints into any organization, and being able to identify and react to phishing emails appropriately will stop these attacks dead in the water. <strong>If you feel that you have received a phishing email, or have fallen victim to an attack, call your company's IT department immediately and follow the appropriate policies and procedures. Don't wait until it's too late!</strong></p>

		<h3>Phishing Indicators</h3>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="./images/phish_training_example.png" /></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Check the email address. If the sender is from an unusual domain it's probably a phish.</li>
			<li>Be suspicious of emails with generic salutations. They could be an indicator that a seemingly personal email went to a lot of people.</li>
			<li>Be suspicious of emails which ask for an immediate action to be taken. That means that an attacker is expecting you to take action without thinking.</li>
			<li>Be careful with links. Hover over the link first and check that the destination matches the link.</li>
			<li>Don't open attachments unless you're expecting one from that specific person or you've verified the attachment is safe via some other means besides email.</li>
			<li>Be mindful of emails containing offers that are 'too good to be true'. More often than not, they are.</li>
		</ul>
